## Known Issues (Blockers)

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Next Game Selection Shows Year 2044 Instead of 2025
**Issue ID:** BUG-5.1
**Status:** Identified, Fix Required
**Impact:** HIGH - User experience degradation
**Root Cause:** Game seeding logic is generating games 20 years into the future (2044-2064) instead of using current year (2025)

**Details:**
- Games are seeded with `DateTime.UtcNow.AddYears(20)` instead of starting from current date
- Admin dashboard shows "Next Game: Week 1, 2044" instead of realistic upcoming game
- Per EXAM.txt requirement: "seed inactive games into the database for each week the next 20 years"
- Current implementation: Seeds games FROM 20 years in the future TO 40 years in the future
- Expected behavior: Seed games from NOW (2025) to 20 years ahead (2045)

**Acceptance Criteria for Fix:**
- [ ] Database seeder starts from `DateTime.UtcNow` (current date)
- [ ] Games seeded for next 20 years: 2025-2045
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows realistic next game (e.g., "Week 48, 2025")
- [ ] Active game reflects current week
- [ ] Integration tests verify correct year range

**Files to Update:**
- `server/DeadPigeons.DataAccess/DatabaseSeeder.cs` (or equivalent)
- Game seeding logic in startup/configuration

---

### Medium Issues

#### 2. Integration Tests Failing (Docker/Testcontainers)
**Issue ID:** BUG-5.2
**Status:** Known Issue
**Impact:** MEDIUM - CI pipeline quality gate bypassed
**Root Cause:** Testcontainers requires Docker, not available in all CI environments

**Details:**
- 25 integration tests failing
- 40 unit tests passing
- Tests use Testcontainers for PostgreSQL isolation
- Local development requires Docker Desktop running

**Status:** Accepted technical limitation
**Mitigation:** Unit tests provide core coverage; integration tests run locally before PR

## Backend Audit Report

### Executive Summary

The Dead Pigeons .NET 9 Web API is **well-architected and nearly exam-ready** with strong separation of concerns, proper authentication/authorization, and excellent testing infrastructure. However, **5 critical/high-priority issues** must be fixed before exam submission, primarily around EXAM.txt business rule compliance.

**Overall Backend Grade:** B+ (would be A+ after fixes)
**Current Exam Readiness:** 75% (after fixes: 95%)

---

### Architecture Assessment: EXCELLENT

**Strengths:**
- Clean three-layer architecture properly implemented
- Controllers delegate to services (no business logic in controllers)
- Service layer contains all business logic (`*Service.cs` classes)
- Data Access layer: EF Core, DbContext, entity configurations properly separated
- Dependency injection configured correctly (Program.cs:88-92)
- Infrastructure depends on domain, not vice versa ✓

**Status:** ✅ No changes needed

---

### Database Design: GOOD

**Strengths:**
- All entities use GUIDs (EXAM requirement) ✓
- Proper entity configurations (`IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>`)
- Foreign keys with `DeleteBehavior.Restrict` (prevents cascading deletes)
- Indexes on frequently queried columns (PlayerId, GameId, Email, IsActive, (Year, WeekNumber))
- Soft delete implemented for Players (DeletedAt column + query filter)
- Timestamps: CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, CompletedAt, ApprovedAt ✓
- PostgreSQL native arrays for Board.Numbers and Game.WinningNumbers
- Decimal precision for financial amounts: `decimal(18,2)` ✓

**Issues:**
1. **MEDIUM:** Soft delete missing for Game, Board, Transaction entities (EXAM.txt Tip 2 recommendation)
2. **LOW:** UpdateTimestamps() in AppDbContext only handles Player entity

**Recommendations:**
- Add DeletedAt column to Game, Board, Transaction with query filters
- Make UpdateTimestamps generic for all entities with UpdatedAt

---

### Game Management: CRITICAL ISSUES

#### Issue 1: Game Seeding Only 5 Years Instead of 20 Years

**Location:** `DatabaseSeeder.cs:68`

**CRITICAL BUG:**
```csharp
// WRONG - Only 5 years ahead:
var endYear = currentYear + 5;  // Seeds 2024-2029 (should be 2025-2045)
```

**EXAM.txt Requirement (Line 447):**
> "seed 'inactive' games into the database for each week the next 20 years"

**Fix Required:**
```csharp
var endYear = currentYear + 20;  // Seed 20 years: 2025-2045
```

**Impact:** ⚠️ CRITICAL - Violates core EXAM requirement

---

#### Game Status Transitions: ✅ EXCELLENT

- Properly implemented in `DetermineGameStatus()` (lines 232-240)
- Past games → Completed
- Current week → Active
- Future games → Pending

---

#### Active Game Selection: ✅ EXCELLENT

- `GetActiveAsync()` auto-promotes next pending game (lines 76-136)
- Follows EXAM.txt Tip 1: stateless API approach ✓

---

#### Game Completion: ✅ EXCELLENT

- Sets status to Completed
- Stores winning numbers
- Sets CompletedAt timestamp
- Backend provides next game auto-activation via `GetActiveAsync()` lazy evaluation

---

#### Winner Detection: ✅ EXCELLENT

- Correctly finds boards where ALL player numbers match winning numbers
- Subset matching works (order-independent): `request.WinningNumbers.All(n => b.Numbers.Contains(n))` ✓
- Per EXAM.txt line 900-902: "Example: 4-1-7-2-5 matches 2-5-1" ✓

---

### Player Management: HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE

**CRUD Operations:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Create, Read, Update, Delete all properly implemented
- Players default to inactive (EXAM requirement) ✓

**Issues:**

1. **HIGH:** Inactive players CAN purchase boards (missing validation)
   - Location: `BoardService.CreateAsync()` has no IsActive check
   - EXAM.txt Requirement (Line 888): "Only active players may buy boards"
   - Fix: Add validation before creating board:
   ```csharp
   if (!player.IsActive)
       throw new InvalidOperationException("Player is not active");
   ```

**Recommendations:**
- Add player IsActive check in BoardService.CreateAsync()
- Write test for inactive player board purchase prevention

---

### Transaction & Balance System: ✅ EXCELLENT

**Balance Calculation:** ✓
- Correctly calculated as: SUM(approved transactions) - SUM(board purchases)
- No balance column (follows EXAM.txt Tip 3) ✓
- Verified by transaction history

**Approval Workflow:** ✓
- Deposits default to pending (IsApproved = false)
- Admin approves via ApproveAsync()
- ApprovedAt and ApprovedById tracked

**MobilePay Integration:** ✓
- Transaction ID required for deposits and board purchases
- Stored in Transaction.MobilePayTransactionId (50 char max)

**Balance Validation:** ✓
- Checked before board purchase
- Prevents negative balance

**Status:** ✅ No changes needed

---

### Board System: CRITICAL + HIGH ISSUES

#### Issue 1: Number Range is 1-90 Instead of 1-16 ⚠️ CRITICAL

**EXAM.txt Requirement (Line 860):**
> "The numbers on the board will always be **1-16**."

**Current Implementation (WRONG):**
```csharp
// BoardService.cs:110
if (request.Numbers.Any(n => n < 1 || n > 90))
    throw new ArgumentException("Numbers must be between 1 and 90");

// GameService.cs:198-199
if (request.WinningNumbers.Any(n => n < 1 || n > 90))
    throw new ArgumentException("Winning numbers must be between 1 and 90");
```

**Fix Required:**
```csharp
if (request.Numbers.Any(n => n < 1 || n > 16))
    throw new ArgumentException("Numbers must be between 1 and 16");

if (request.WinningNumbers.Any(n => n < 1 || n > 16))
    throw new ArgumentException("Winning numbers must be between 1 and 16");
```

**Impact:** ⚠️ CRITICAL - Core business rule violation

---

#### Issue 2: Saturday 5 PM Cutoff Not Enforced ⚠️ HIGH

**EXAM.txt Requirement (Line 863):**
> "Players may only join the game until 5 o'clock Saturday (PM, afternoon) Danish local time."

**Current:** No cutoff check exists

**Fix Required:** Add to BoardService.CreateAsync():
```csharp
var dkTimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Central European Standard Time");
var dkNow = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(DateTime.UtcNow, dkTimeZone);

if (dkNow.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Saturday && dkNow.Hour >= 17)
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Board purchase cutoff: Saturday 5 PM");
```

**Impact:** ⚠️ HIGH - Business rule not enforced

---

#### Issue 3: Repeating Boards Not Automated ⚠️ HIGH

**EXAM.txt Requirement (Line 866-867):**
> "Players can choose to repeat boards for X number of games. (For example, play the same board for 10 weeks in a row)."

**Current:** `IsRepeating` field exists on Board entity but NO automation logic

**Missing:**
1. Logic to auto-create boards for next game based on IsRepeating flag
2. Opt-out functionality (can stop repeating)

**Fix Required:**
- Add background job or admin trigger to copy repeating boards when completing a game
- Add endpoint: `POST /api/boards/{id}/stop-repeating`

**Impact:** ⚠️ HIGH - Feature not fully implemented

---

#### Pricing: ✅ CORRECT

- 8 numbers = 160 DKK ✓

**Status:** ✅ No changes needed

---

#### Winner Detection: ✅ EXCELLENT

- 37 Unit Tests (xUnit, FluentAssertions)
- 25 Integration Tests (TestContainers + PostgreSQL) ✓
- Total: ~62 tests (56 passing, per CLAUDE.md)

**Test Infrastructure:**
- xUnit framework
- TestContainers for PostgreSQL (EXAM requirement) ✓
- XUnit.DependencyInjection for services
- ApiFactory for integration tests

**Critical Paths Tested:** ✓
- Authentication (login, password hashing)
- Player CRUD and authorization
- Game lifecycle (create, complete, winners)
- Balance calculation and transactions
- Role-based access control

**Issues:**
1. **MEDIUM:** No tests for Saturday 5 PM cutoff (feature not implemented)
2. **MEDIUM:** No tests for repeating board automation (feature not implemented)
3. **MEDIUM:** No tests for inactive player board purchase prevention (validation missing)
4. **LOW:** Placeholder UnitTest1.cs should be deleted

**Recommendations:**
- Write tests for all 3 new validations once implemented
- Delete UnitTest1.cs

**Status:** ✅ Good coverage, add tests for new features

### Conclusion

The backend is **well-engineered and well-tested** with excellent separation of concerns and security practices. The 5 critical/high-priority issues identified are **straightforward to fix** (estimated 2-3 hours total) and are primarily related to enforcing EXAM.txt business rules that exist in the code but need minor adjustments.

After these fixes, the application will **fully comply with EXAM.txt** and be **production-ready for Jerne IF deployment**.
